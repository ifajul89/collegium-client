          review="I love the design and functionality of Collegium. The search feature works great, and the college cards provide all the necessary details in one place. I especially liked the section that showcases college research papersâ€”it gives a real sense of the academic strengths of each institution. Only thing missing for me is a comparison tool, but overall, it's a fantastic resource!"
